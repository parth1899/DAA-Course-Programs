# **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Assignments**  

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms taught in the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course. The assignments cover a range of fundamental algorithmic problems, including sorting, searching, combinatorial problems, and majority element detection.  

## **Assignments Overview**  

### **Assignment 1: Derangements & Maximum Updates**  
1. **Number of Derangements** – Counting valid permutations where no element appears in its original position.  
2. **Max Updates in Unsorted Array** – Finding the average number of updates required to track the maximum element for all possible `n!` arrays.  

### **Assignment 2: Sorting Algorithms**  
1. **Quick Sort** – A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm with an average time complexity of `O(n log n)`.  
2. **K-Way Merge Sort** – A variation of merge sort that merges `k` sorted sequences efficiently.  

### **Assignment 3: Josephus Problem**  
1. **Array-Based Solution** – Simulates the elimination process using an array.  
2. **Circular Linked List-Based Solution** – Implements an efficient approach using a circular linked list.  

### **Assignment 4: Fast Modular Exponentiation**  
1. **Brute Force Approach** – Computes exponentiation using straightforward multiplication.  
2. **Recursive Approach** – Uses divide-and-conquer for efficient modular exponentiation.  

### **Assignment 5: Majority Element Search**  
A number is a **majority element** if it appears more than `n/2` times in an array. Implementations include:  
1. **Brute Force** – Counts occurrences for each element.  
2. **Sorting-Based Approach** – Uses sorting to locate the majority element.  
3. **Boyer-Moore Majority Voting Algorithm** – A space-efficient algorithm to find the majority element in `O(n)` time.
